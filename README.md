Implement storage for each user of a list of text message settings: font name, font size, font color, style. Create a window application containing an input field (for entering user settings), a button (for saving settings), an input field (for label text), an inscription (contains formatted text from the second input field), a drop-down list (for user selection). The application implements the following functions:
(1) When the button is clicked, saves in the database the settings for the user entered in the first input field;

(2) When entering text in the second input field, displays this text in the caption;

(3) When selecting a username from the drop-down list, automatically formats the text in the caption according to the settings of the selected user.
